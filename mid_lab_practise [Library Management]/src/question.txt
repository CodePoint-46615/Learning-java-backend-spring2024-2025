You are asked to develop a simple library system that stores different types of books.
Each book should have a title, author, genre, and price. The genre should be implemented
using an enum. Use generics to create a class that can store any type of media (not just books).
Implement a functional interface for filtering books. Use lambda expressions and method references
where appropriate. Also:

Use var (Local Variable Type Inference) wherever possible.
Use the ternary operator to display whether the book is expensive (price > 500).
Use a nested class inside the generic media class to display media info.
Annotate methods with @Override and create a custom annotation called @Important.
Use Stream API to filter and sort the books.
Demonstrate variable-length arguments to add multiple books at once.
Use a higher-order function to apply a discount strategy.
